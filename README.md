Practice makes perfect - sharpening my HTML and CSS tools

I have learnt, searched and practiced the following tools:
* CSS Grids, https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
* Burger menu, inpired from https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/poWRrQW?editors=1100
* Object positioning
* Some animations

This project is inspired from an awwward site. It's way cooler than my own version.

It took me 6-7 hours to realise this project after a lot of trial and error and research for different elements.
